#Multi Threaded Client Server Application in C

A simple multi threaded client server application written in C
using POSIX API's for Multi Threading and IPC (Sockets)

##Server Setup

Run make and then execute server like so:

./server from terminal

Note, default server port is 2342 - It is defined as constant in constants.h, so you may change the server port and other configuration options from there. All events are logged to standard log (/var/log/syslog). Log Levels are defined in log.h

##Client Setup

Launch client like so:

./client serverip

so, if server is running on 192.168.1.1 you'd run it like so:

./client 192.168.1.1

##Client to Client Communication

Users can also establish direct connections with each their through server.(Note that, server acts as intermediary initially but later on client to client communication is totally independent of server )

## User Accounts

Account Info is stored users.txt file - File is protected using mutex to ensure thread safety as it's accessed in multiple threads.
